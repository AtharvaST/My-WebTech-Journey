            <li>Boil Water</li>
            <ul type ="disc">
                <li>Start by boiling fresh cold water. Use a kettle or a pot to heat the water. It's best to use cold, filtered water to ensure the best taste.</ul>
            <li>Preheat</li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>If you have a teapot, rinse it with hot water to warm it up. If you're using a teacup, simply pour some hot water into it and then discard the water. This preheating step helps maintain the tea's temperature.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add Tea Leaves or Tea Bag</li>
            <ul type ="disc">
                <li>Place the tea leaves or tea bag into your teapot or teacup. The amount of tea used can vary depending on personal preference, but a general guideline is one teaspoon of loose tea leaves per cup or one tea bag per cup.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pour Hot Water</li>
            <ul type = "disc">
                <li> Once the water has reached a rolling boil, pour it over the tea leaves or tea bag in the teapot or teacup. Make sure the water covers the tea completely.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Steep the Tea: </li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Cover the teapot or teacup with a lid or saucer to trap the heat. Let the tea steep for the recommended time, which can vary depending on the type of tea you're using:</li>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Black tea: 3-5 minutes</li>

                    <li>Oolong tea: 3-4 minutes</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <li>Remove Tea Leaves or Tea Bag:</li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>After the steeping time, remove the tea leaves or tea bag from the teapot or teacup. If you leave it in for too long, the tea can become bitter.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Optional Addition: </li>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>If you like your tea sweetened, add sugar, honey, or any other sweetener of your choice while the tea is hot. Stir well until the sweetener dissolves.</li>
                <li>For creamy tea, add a splash of milk or cream to taste. Adjust the amount to your liking.</li>
            </ul>
